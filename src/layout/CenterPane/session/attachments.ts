//! Images waiting in the composer, from the moment they are pasted or dropped until they are sent.
//!
//! The chat engine takes an image as base64 inside the message itself, so nothing is written to disk on the
//! way — unlike the terminal path in `terminal/imageInput.ts`, which uploads a file and types its path,
//! because a terminal can only carry text. What the two share is how an image is fished out of a paste or a
//! drop, and that part is reused rather than written twice.
//!
//! An image wider or taller than `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE` is redrawn smaller before it is sent. See that constant
//! for why.
