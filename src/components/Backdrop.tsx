//! Modal backdrop shell that standardizes the outer structure and click-outside behavior of full-screen-backdrop,
//! centered-card dialogs.
//!
//! Previously, every dialog hand-wrote its backdrop div (position:fixed, inset:0, centering, and onClick close).
//! Besides duplication, that pattern made it easy to dismiss a dialog accidentally while dragging a text
//! selection (see useBackdropDismiss). Centralizing the shell here makes new dialogs safe by default with only
//! `<Backdrop onClose={...}>…card…</Backdrop>`.
//!
//! Props cover variants: zIndex controls stacking; dim controls translucent darkening (false gives anchored
//! panels a transparent backdrop); center controls flex centering (false lets children position themselves).
